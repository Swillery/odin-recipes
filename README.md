# Odin Recipes HTML Project

This is a self-assessment/project that will be following "The Odin Project"'s curriculum to complete.

This will be a project that uses my basic HTML and git skills.

In this project I should be able to display adequacy in creating HTML code for basic webpages, using proper syntax for that code, writing a good git commit message.
