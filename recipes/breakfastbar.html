    <h1>How To Make Baked Oatmeal Bars</h1>
        <p>Making homemade breakfast bars is so simple and it only takes 10 minutes of prep time (that's quicker than going to the store and buying a box of granola bars).</p>
        <p>You'll find the full detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making these baked oatmeal bars.</p>

    <h2>Mix Dry Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Combine oats, sugars, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl.</p>

    <h2>Mix Wet Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Whisk milk, eggs, canola oil, and vanilla together. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients until combined. Let this mixture sit for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h2>Bake</h2>
        <p>Spoon the mixture into the pan and bake until the edges are golden brown. Allow to cool before cutting and serving.</p>

    <h2>Optional Additions</h2>
        <p>The best part about making granola bars at home is that you can add whatever you like. We suggest adding nuts, cranberries, raisins, berries, or chocolate chips.</p>
